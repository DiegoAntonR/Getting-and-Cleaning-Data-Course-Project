#Variables
The files that have been used to load data are listed as follows:
·test/subject
·test/X_test.txt
·test/y_test.txt
·train/subject_train.txt
·train/X_train.txt
·train/y_train.txt


Values of Varible Activity consist of data from “Y_train.txt” and “Y_test.txt”
values of Varible Subject consist of data from “subject_train.txt” and subject_test.txt"
Values of Varibles Features consist of data from “X_train.txt” and “X_test.txt”
Names of Varibles Features come from “features.txt”
levels of Varible Activity come from “activity_labels.txt”
So we will use Activity, Subject and Features as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame.

Finally, tidydataset contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file. ddply() from the plyr package 
is used to apply colMeans() and ease the development.
